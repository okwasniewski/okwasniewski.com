## The new thing

While working on [React Native visionOS](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-visionos) I've added a new API that adds a hover effect when the user looks at an element. As it turns out, the same API is used on iPadOS to apply hover effects when using a mouse!

Later, I teamed up together with [Saad Najmi](https://twitter.com/SaadNajmi) from Microsoft to create a RFC which described this feature, you can check it [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/750).

After the idea got validated in the RFC, Saad created a [PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/43078) for it. 

And that's how the new `cursor` style got introduced!

## Demo

If you add this style to any view it will have a hover effect on iPad:

```tsx
<TouchableOpacity style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}>  
	<Text>Click me</Text>  
</TouchableOpacity>
```
_Note: It doesn't have to be a Touchable view._

I've added the style to built-in New App Screen:

### Before

<video controls width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dangiiuvf/video/upload/f_auto:video,q_auto/clloxjd73indjwdn4jl6" />

### After

<video controls width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dangiiuvf/video/upload/f_auto:video,q_auto/pwr6cnuvap7haj0tk8y8" />

Adding this feature to your app can greatly improve your users experience on iPad.
