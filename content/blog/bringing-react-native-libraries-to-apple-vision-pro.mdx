## Introduction
Apple Vision Pro is just around the corner, and it's a great time to contribute visionOS support to your favorite React Native libraries.

For the past few months, we've been working hard at [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/) to bring React Native into a new dimension by creating a new out-of-tree platform.

?> Out-of-tree platform: A fork of the React Native core, extending its possibilities to new platforms. Examples of such projects include [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and [React Native tvOS](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos).

To learn more about this project, check out our recent podcast here:

## Migrating libraries
Remember that only libraries using **native code** need migration; JS-only libraries will work out of the box. Here is a step-by-step explanation on how to bring a library to visionOS: 

1. Make sure you have proper Xcode setup, described in [React Native visionOS README](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-visionos/blob/main/README.md)
2. Initialize a new visionOS project
```sh
npx @callstack/react-native-visionos init MyApp
```

3. Install library that you want to migrate
```sh
yarn add your-library
```

4. Navigate to the `node_modules` directory and locate your library's code

6. Add visionOS support to library podspec: 
```rb title="YourLibrary.podspec" {10}
#..
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name         = "react-native-slider"
  s.version      = package['version']
  s.summary      = package['description']
  s.license      = package['license']

  s.authors      = package['author']
  s.homepage     = package['homepage']
  s.platforms    = { :ios => "9.0", :visionos => "1.0" } # <- Add visionOS here 

  s.source       = { :git => "https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider.git", :tag => "v#{s.version}" }
  # ...
```

This snippet comes from [react-native-slider.podspec](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider/blob/main/package/react-native-slider.podspec). For this library all it took was to add this one line. https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider/pull/560

7. Next, open the project located in the `MyApp/visionos` directory in Xcode and run the app (remember to install CocoaPods).
8. Xcode will likely show additional error messages that need to be addressed. In the next section, I will discuss the most common errors and issues.
9. Once your library is compiling you can use `npx patch-package` to save the changes 
10. Use generated `.patch` file to contribute to the library. 

?> At this point we don't recommend libraries to add visionOS example, as the template is changing pretty frequently with breaking changes.

## Common issues
### Usage of `UIScreen`
This API is not available on visionOS as there is no concept of "screen". Apple Vision Pro displays apps in shared space where each app has its own window.

There are two main reasons your library might be using `UIScreen`: 

**Getting screen dimensions**

Here is the code that will fail when compiling for visionOS: 
`[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size;` 

In order to replace it, you need to retrieve currently focused `UIWindowScene` of your app and get it's `keyWindow`.

Here is an example: 
```objc {14-16}
UIWindow *__nullable RCTKeyWindow(void)
{
  if (RCTRunningInAppExtension()) {
    return nil;
  }

  for (UIScene* scene in RCTSharedApplication().connectedScenes) {
    if (scene.activationState != UISceneActivationStateForegroundActive || ![scene isKindOfClass:[UIWindowScene class]]) {
      continue;
    }
    UIWindowScene *windowScene = (UIWindowScene *)scene;

    for (UIWindow *window in windowScene.windows) {
      if (window.isKeyWindow) {
        return window;
      }
    }
  }

  return nil;
}
```

**Retrieve current screen info, like: scale**

Instead of using `UIScreen`, we can utilize `currentTraitCollection`, a property defined in the environment.

Trait collection originates in the screen (`UIScreen`) and contains considerable number of properties describing the environment. For example: `displayScale` can tell us the current screen scale of the device. 

```objc
CGFloat currentScale = [UITraitCollection currentTraitCollection].displayScale;
```

### Unsupported APIs
Some APIs are not available on visionOS because they don't map to this platform. For example: `inputAccessoryView` is not available because the keyboard is floating next to our screen and we can't display anything there. 

To deal with unsupported APIs we can use compiler conditionals: 

```objc {2,4}
- (void)shouldDismissKeyboard:(RNCViewPagerKeyboardDismissMode)dismissKeyboard {
#if !TARGET_OS_VISION 
    UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissMode dismissKeyboardMode = UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissModeNone;
#endif
}
```

Code between `#if !TARGET_OS_VISION` and `#endif` won't be compiled for visionOS. 

Here is a Swift equivalent for this: 
```swift
#if !os(visionOS)
// Swift code
#endif
```

### Deprecated APIs
Unfortunately, visionOS doesn't support APIs deprecated before iOS 15. So if your library uses older APIs it's great time to update to a newer alternative. 

Here is an example of migrating `UIMenuController` to `UIEditMenuInteraction` within the React Native core: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/41125.

This is where `@available` comes in handy, allowing you to keep the old implementation and preserve backward compatibility.
