### About

React Native SVG Decoder extends the built-in Image component with SVG capabilities. It uses Apple's CoreSVG to render SVG images natively on iOS.

> **Note:** This library is iOS only.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-svg-decoder
```

## Usage

Just install the package and use the built-in Image component as usual. SVG images will be automatically supported.

## For Library Authors

You can integrate this package as a dependency to enable SVG functionality in your library. If your native code already utilizes `RCTImageLoader` for image loading, SVG images will be supported automatically — no additional configuration required.
